# Optimizing Online Sports Retail Revenue
 
# Project README

This project aims to analyze product data from an online sports clothing company in order to provide recommendations for improving revenue. The dataset provided includes five tables: `info`, `finance`, `reviews`, `traffic`, and `brands`. The primary key for all tables is `product_id`. Below is a brief description of each table:

## info
- `product_name`: Name of the product
- `product_id`: Unique ID for product
- `description`: Description of the product

## finance
- `product_id`: Unique ID for product
- `listing_price`: Listing price for product
- `sale_price`: Price of the product when on sale
- `discount`: Discount, as a decimal, applied to the sale price
- `revenue`: Amount of revenue generated by each product, in US dollars

## reviews
- `product_name`: Name of the product
- `product_id`: Unique ID for product
- `rating`: Product rating, scored from 1.0 to 5.0
- `reviews`: Number of reviews for the product

## traffic
- `product_id`: Unique ID for product
- `last_visited`: Date and time the product was last viewed on the website

## brands
- `product_id`: Unique ID for product
- `brand`: Brand of the product

## 1. Counting missing values
In this notebook, we first count the number of missing values in the dataset. We use a SQL query to join the `info`, `finance`, and `traffic` tables and count the non-missing entries for the `description`, `listing_price`, and `last_visited` columns. The result shows the total number of rows and the counts for each column.

## 2. Nike vs Adidas pricing
Next, we analyze the pricing of Nike and Adidas products in the dataset. We run a SQL query to select the brand, listing_price as an integer, and the count of all products in the `finance` table. We join the `brands` table to the `finance` table on the `product_id` and filter for products with a listing_price greater than zero. The results are grouped by brand and listing_price, and sorted by listing_price in descending order.

## 3. Labeling price ranges
To further analyze the pricing data, we assign labels to different price ranges and group the results by brand and label. We also include the total revenue for each price range and brand. We use a SQL query to select the brand, count of products, total revenue, and create four labels based on the price range. The results are grouped by brand and price_category and sorted by total_revenue.

Please refer to the notebook for the detailed SQL queries and their results.
